### theme settings

x image primary color
x image secondary color     offline/disconnected items
x color scheme text
color scheme read graph
color scheme write graph

support multiple theme colors
at run time we choose wich one we want


### app design
- java loads themes.yml file
- provided color scheme is extracted from themes file, this becomes the "root" data model
- java loads global yml configuration and appends to root data model
- merge each ftl template with the data model
- bash script dynamically creates sidebar file in /tmp folder
- final conky scripts are moved to the target folder

java printConky.jar <conky theme> <color>
                        \
                        this determines the source directory with the config files
                                            target directory in the /monochrome folder


### prepare ftl files

$ sed -i 's/green-/[=image.secondaryColor]-/' !(config|scripts|*.yml|color-palette|packages|processes)
$ prename 's/$/.ftl/' !(scripts|*.yml|color-palette|packages|processes)

### freemarker advanced coding
- provide a list of disk devices, freemarker code generates all the blocks
- can the network setup be done in a single configuration?

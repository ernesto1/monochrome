# Build assets
This directory contains the source code to build the supporting java applications for this project:

- Conky configurations generator using freemarker templates
- D-Bus music player listener

Java applications are built using maven.  The maven project is under the `java-tools` directory.

### Bug tracking
Any conky issues I've had to compensate for are tracking in this [log](bugLog.md).  
This may help explain why I had to make certain design decisions.

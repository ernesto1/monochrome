# notes
# by default conky will reload its configuration if it detects a change on the file
# 
# the new conky configuration is created in a temporary folder and then the target file is overriden
# it turns out that if too many sequential file changes happen to the conky file, conky stops reloading the file
# hence why we use the temp folder in order to replace the file only once

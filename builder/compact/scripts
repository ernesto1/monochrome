# notes
# by default conky will reload its configuration if detects a change on the file
# 
# the new conky configuration is created in a temporary folder and then the target file is overriden
# it turns out that if too many sequential file changes happen to the conky file, conky stops reloading the file
# hence why we use the temp folder in order to replace the file only once

# ::::::: desktop sidebar
mkdir -p /tmp/monochrome;\
buildSidebar.bash config cpu-mem network-desktop disk disk-desktop disk-usb system bottom-edge;\
echo ']];' >> /tmp/monochrome/sidebar;\
mv /tmp/monochrome/sidebar ~/conky/monochrome/compact/sidebar

# :::::::  laptop sidebar | under construction
mkdir -p /tmp/monochrome;\

echo ']];' >> /tmp/monochrome/sidebar;\

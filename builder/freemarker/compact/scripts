# notes
# by default conky will reload its configuration if it detects a change on the file
# 
# the new conky configuration is created in a temporary folder and then the target file is overriden
# it turns out that if too many sequential file changes happen to the conky file, conky stops reloading the file
# hence why we use the temp folder in order to replace the file only once

# ::::::: desktop sidebar
java -jar ~/conky/monochrome/java/freemarker-configuration-*.jar compact burgundy desktop && \
mv /tmp/monochrome/{sidebar,applications} ~/conky/monochrome/compact && \

# design notes
- images should have a top/bottom border of 7px
- left border for text is 6px
- each row of text adds 16 pixels (lines with a 3px voffset)
- each row of text adds 13 pixels (no voffset like a cat or exec command)
- measure up to the bottom of the dot, 1px below the words

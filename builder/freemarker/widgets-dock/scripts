# notes
# by default conky will reload its configuration if it detects a change on the file
# 
# The new conky configuration is created in a temporary folder and then the target file is overriden.
# It turns out that if too many sequential file changes happen to the conky file, conky stops reloading the file.
# Hence why we use the temp folder in order to replace the file only once
#
# the java freemarker template app will output the conky blocks in the /tmp/monochrome folder

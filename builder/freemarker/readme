:::: data model for the conky freemarker template configuration
the data model for the conky templates is composed of two sections:

  - hardware details
  - conky theme color palette (colorPalette.yml found on each individual conky folder)

when a configuration is being built for a particular conky theme (ex. compact conky)
these two data models will be merged and used by the freemarker engine
